    <p><strong>Wolf Warrior Diplomacy</strong> describes an aggresive style of diplomacy adopted by <strong>Chinese
            diplomates</strong> in the 21th century under Chinese leader
        <strong> Xi jinping's</strong> administration. The term was coined from a Rambo-style Chinese action film wolf
        worrier 2. This style contrasts to prior Chinese diplomatics
        practices that were maximized as "Taoguange Yanghuai" means "cover light and nurture in the dark, or keep a low
        profile" by <strong>Deng Xioping</strong>, which had emphasized
        the avoidence of controvercy and the use of cooperative rhetoric. This chengyu("idiom") is an abbreviation of
        Deng's stretegy <strong>"observe calmly,secure our position, cope
            with affairs calmly, hide our capacities and bide our time,be good at maintaining a low profile, and never
            claim leadership." </strong> Wolf worrior diplomacy is confrontational
        and combative, with its proponents loudly denouncing any criticism of China on social media and in interview. As
        an attemp to gain "discource power" in international politics,
        Wolf warrior diplomacy forms one part of a new foreign policy stretegy called Xi jinping's <strong>"major
            Country Diplomacy"</strong> which has legitimized a more active role
        China on the world stage, including engaging in open <strong>ideological</strong> competition with the
        <strong>west.</strong>
